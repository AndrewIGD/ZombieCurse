Hundreds of years ago, a powerful wizard attacked our village with powerful spells. Our people tried to defend themselves against him, but he simply overpowered them. When our people asked him what was his purpose, he said that he wanted to loot the village of it's belongings and become rich. It was then that our people proposed that they would pay him every week with gold and goods if he would not destroy their village. The wizard accepted. But... it would not last for long, as the wizard kept wanting more, and the new generations became annoyed. Because of this, our village stopped paying the wizard, and when the wizard noticed, he cursed us with a spell that bringed back the dead and attack us.
